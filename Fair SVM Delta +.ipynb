    "# Making The SVM$_\\Delta$+ Fair\n",

For clarity, $\\bar{z}$ is the mean average position of the sensitive features $z$."

    "This is meant to be a general form for classifiers. But we're using an SVM, so here's my argument. If we have the unsigned distance, $y_id_\\theta (x_i)$ couldn't we just have one constraint? So $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(z_i - \\bar{z})y_i d_\\theta (x_i) \\leq c$?\n",

I *think* the reason this wouldn't have been suggested is that the slack variable $\\xi$ will always ensure that the margin is ensured.
